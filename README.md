#Tic Tac Toe in C

Well, after my successful Python implementation of the riveting and
complex game of Tic-Tac-Toe I've decided to try to write the same thing in
C for practice.

Organization of the project:

    - The game executable is generated by compiling the `ticTacToe.c`
      file.
    - Some functions are separated (more or less randomly) into `ticTac.h`
